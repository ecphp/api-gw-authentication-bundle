# API Gateway Authentication

A bundle for PHP >= 7.4 and Symfony 5.

This bundle provides the necessary to authenticate a request based on a specific HTTP header.

It has been written to facilitate the authentication of requests from [API Gateway][http wso2 documentation].

This bundle relies on [lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle][http lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle]
and provide a specific KeyLoader.

The features it provides are:

- Provides default configuration to work with API Gateway,
- Has a failsafe mechanism for public key retrieval and embed the public keys of the default API Gateway in case of failure,
- Provides a default `UserProvider` service and `User` entity,

## To follow

2 patches needs to be committed in [lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle][http lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle]:

- [#832](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/pull/832)
- [#833](https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle/pull/833)

## API Gateway

The European Commission API Gateway service allows you to deploy microservices as APIs behind the Gateway.

The Gateway offers an added layer of security and multiple useful utilities such as:

- API protection with tokens
- API lifecycle management
- API versioning
- API traffic management & throttling
- API analytics
- API management automation
- No hassle API publication with swagger
- Store of APIs to reuse

This service is based on the open source project [WSO2 API Gateway][http wso2 website], in a distributed deployment with custom components.

## Installation

- The package is not yet public, so you must manually add its repository to your application `composer.json` file:

```json
    "repositories": [{
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://citnet.tech.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/stash/scm/ecphp/api-gw-authenticator.git"

    }],
```

- `composer require ecphp/api-gw-authentication-bundle:dev-master`

- Copy all the files from `vendor/ecphp/api-gw-authentication/Resources/config/packages/dev/` inside your application `config` folder environment (`dev`, `test` or `prod`).

- Configure the API Gateway environment accordingly in the configuration file `api_gw_authentication.yaml`:

```yaml
api_gw_authentication:
    defaults:
        env: acceptance # Available values are: acceptance, intra, production

security:
    providers:
        api_gw_authentication:
            id: api_gw_authentication.user_provider
```

- Copy the file `vendor/ecphp/api-gw-authenticator/Resources/config/routes/api_gw_authentication.yaml` inside your Symfony `routes` folder (`dev`, `test` or `prod`). For security reasons, it's better to only enable those routes on the `dev` environment.

- Copying those files will be obsolete when the package will be OpenSourced and a Symfony recipe will be created.

- Edit the configuration file `api_gw_authentication.yaml` and configure the API Gateway environment.
  3 choices are possible:
  - `intra`
  - `acceptance`
  - `production`
  - `custom` (this is only for testing)

- Configure the security of your application through `config/packages/security.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    security:
        firewalls:
            default:
                anonymous: ~
                stateless: true
                guard:
                    provider: api_gw_authentication
                    authenticators:
                      - lexik_jwt_authentication.jwt_token_authenticator
        access_control:
            - { path: ^/api, role: IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY }
    ```

- Get a valid token from API Gateway.

- Make a request to `/api/user` with the `Authorization` header.

```shell
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/user" -H "Authorization: Bearer <insert-token-here>"
```
